MWB Session 5 -> Java Session 1

Identifiers

Rules
1. Possible characters
{ A-Z
a-z
0-9
$, _ }
 error. 
2. Identifiers should never be named with a digit (0-9), "9Hello" : this identifier name is Invalid
3. In Java the identifier names are case sensitive. So that means that Hello and hello are 2 different identifier names. 
4. Optimal length of the identifier should be between (4 - 15) -> not a strict condition
5. As usual for any programming language we cannnot use Reserved words as identifier names. For example if you'll name your identifier as 'float', this would throw an error. 

Some valid Identifiers: 'philip', 'PHILIP', 'philip_2'
The community prefers using Camel Case
Camel Case example: TodoHelicopterFly

Data Types

Two types of data types: Primitive and Non-Primitive

1. Primitive

Major Classification:
integer: byte, int, short, long
floating point: float and double
character = char
boolea type = boolean

Sizes:
a. int (4 bytes = 32 bits)
b. float (4 bytes = 32 bits)
c. boolean (1 bit)
d. char (2 bytes = 16 bits)  
e. byte (1 byte = 8 bits)
f. short (2 bytes = 16 bits)
g. long (8 bytes = 64 bits)
h. double (8 bytes = 64 bits)

2. Non-Primitive

a. Array 
An array is a group of like-typed variables that are referred to by a common name. 

b. String
An array of characters. 

//More on theis in the later sessions.

Goals for Session 6
1. Setup the environment, if you dont get time to do so!
2. Memory Map for Java (How actually Java stores the information?, How does the JVM work?)
3. Learn the remaining Primitive Data Types (class, object and the interface (basic definition))
4. Java class file
5. Scope of variables
